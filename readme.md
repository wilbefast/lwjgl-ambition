"AMBITION" ENGINE -- LWJGL IMPLEMENTATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A reimplementation of the abstract "Ambition" game engine using LWJGL
(Light-Weight Java Game-Library) for hardware-accelerated graphics. This has 
been seperated from the main "Ambition" project so that people without need of
OpenGL can compile the main project more easily, without having to worry about
native libraries and dependencies.
